# HowFast
- This is a program that allows you to constantly view how fast you're going along with sending off conditional notifications to your phone when you reach certan speeds.
- You can also measure your average speed between two points, by pressing start tracking, and then stop tracking when you're down the road etc.
- The notifications are configurable - for example, when you reach 15 miles an hour, a notification will pop up - "You've surpassed 15mph".
- This is all configurable and you can choose to have your speed unit in MPH or KMPH, it's up to the user.
